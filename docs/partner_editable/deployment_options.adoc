// There are generally two deployment options. If additional are required, add them here

This Quick Start provides one deployment option:

* *Deploy Calico into an existing EKS cluster*. This option provisions Calico or Calico Enterprise in your existing AWS infrastructure.

The Quick Start lets you configure the EKS cluster in which Calico will be installed, as discussed later in this guide.
